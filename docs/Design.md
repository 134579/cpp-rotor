# Design

## Notions

`address` is runtime entity, served as subscription and delivery point. Any `message` can
be sent to an address; any `actor` can subscribe on any kind of messages on any address.
An `address` is generated by `supervisor`, address holds strong reference to `supervisor`.

`message` is runtime entity, which consists of destination `address` and user supplied
mutable `payload`. Message are delivered to `actors`. **The order of delivery messages
is unspecified**. The delivery itself to an actor is **not guaranteed**, not in the
sense the `rotor` will loose it, but because the actor migth be not yet ready for it
(not subscribed), or the actor migth be no longer ready for it (i.e. already unsubscribed).
`payload` is **mutable**. It is user responsibility to allowed for an `actor` to change
a payload in a thread-safe way, but it is recommended to do modifications only
when it is known that an `actor` is single consumer of the message; if there are multiple
consumers of the the messages it is recommended to do not chage the message, or provide
synchronization mechanisms on the payload (discouraged).
